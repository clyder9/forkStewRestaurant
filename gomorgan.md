Morgan,

I was surprised by our phone call on Friday, May 29th following the transfer of my draft response letter mistakenly passed too early to Rob Merbach of the HR department.  In that letter, I prematurely suggested a moderate increase of the severance inducements offered to me by Restaurant 365.  

When you called my phone almost immediately after Rob had received that letter, it was immediately clear that you disagreed strongly with the spirit of that content (see attached first draft letter) and particularly because I had sought out counsel in order to make that response.  This was unexpected because the Restaurant 365 separation letter delivered two weeks earlier clearly suggests that I seek counsel before responding.  I was most alarmed, however, by your follow-on comment expressing your displeasure with my severance response in which you essentially said, as I wrote it down directly after the call --- “I could sink your reputation in Southern California, making you un-hirable.  Is that what you want here?”  

Please know that I am only seeking some extra help from the firm to counterbalance what I believe to be valid reasons justifying this request and supplied in my previous letter.  I view this as a simple negotiation between us to see if we can reach some mutually agreeable conclusion so that I can sign your letter thereby releasing you from any potential future obligation to me.

Since your call, and upon further reflection trying to understand why Restaurant 365 may have severed me from employment—especially considering the positive response by customers about my work (even you congratulated me on this) also my work ethic while employed at the firm--it concerns me that only three weeks before receiving this separation notice, I had mentioned to Rob Merbach in HR and to ______, who works closely with ______ (founder) that I am challenged with a form of mental illness potentially requiring me to take a leave of absence to regain my health.  The timing of my separation is also concerning in light of the company’s planned realignment of its health care benefits and insurance coverage.  These points suggest the potential that my health status may have been factored into the decision to terminate my employment.



At this point, I have not notified the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) or the federal administrative agency--the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) of the potential that discrimination may have occurred in this situation.  Rather, I am reaching out once more to you to see if we can come to some form of amicable agreement between us in which you could help to me to …



either find another good job and if not to increase the financial resources offered me in the form of a longer severance period to accommodate me as I attempt to make this transition.  And even more preferable to me than either of these two alternatives would be to continue to work for Restaurant 365.  


In my draft letter to the company, I stated that I suffer from mental illness.  Despite this extra challenge, which is now making it difficult for me to acquire new employment, while employed at Restaurant 365 I believe my performance was exemplary, never missing a day of work and offering assistance well beyond my job’s remit.  In the time since I’ve departed direct interaction with the company, I have rarely left my apartment.  Having communicated my mental-state challenges to you in that letter, it seems a bit strange that the company, which prides itself on helping employees, has opted to ignore my request for help, thereby encouraging me to write this letter.  

Further, the 

My point is that despite the challenges that I have, I was able to perform the work for your compay in a way that should have been satifiactory to you, with frequent efforts on my part to extend my services beyond that general scope of my job mandate.

And so considering these facts and the letter email that I sent to you upon your suggestion that you might be willing to help me find new employment – but without response from you, indicating what apperast to me to be little interest in helping me (perhaps because of potential concern that association with me might lead to borader action in connection with my declarion of mental illness and ultimate separation from the company.  

In all of this, I feel that the company has underserved me when in fact my whole interest and action was to provide service to the company for the betterment of those associated with it and particulary those whith equity ownership in the company.


On this last point, it would appear, especially considering your reaction to my draft (and in contrast inconsequential request) it may be you in particular and others in the company are so disinclined to associate with me that this might not be possible.  You should know, that I bear no such feelings toward the company and would happily rejoin as I had a great experience and association working there.

Rather than to describe further my potential actigfinty associated with the EOXXX of Cal associated with discrimination investigation, I prefer to hear from your to see if we might come to some sort of agreement.  Failing that you should know that my intent is to file such a claim with that department, which would be accompanied by discovery actions, in which I would be afforded the opportunity to ask direct questions about the direct intent and conversation within the company regarding any potential mention regarding my mental illness and potential need for health insurance accommodation.

I have been informed that this discovery process under oath will allow me a significant ability to question indivdiuals within the company concerning the thought process associated with my departure.  You should know that another fact that appears to be associated with this situation is that the company is in the midst of changing its health care provision from one that is widely accommodating and thus potentially benefitual to me in that sense to one that might not be so accommodating and that my departure might have been associated with those converaat4ions as well.  Again, my preference is to have a honest and professional conversation with yuou, one in which you might ber willing to help me in my situation, rather than to have an antagonistic relationship in which we are only able to come to some sort of an agrememnet under the threat of future action on my part.
