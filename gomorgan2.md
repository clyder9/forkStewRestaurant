Morgan,

I was surprised by our phone call on Friday, May 29th following the transfer of my draft response letter mistakenly passed too early to Rob Merbach of the HR department.  In that letter, I prematurely suggested an excessively moderate, two week increase of the severance inducements offered to me by Restaurant 365.  

When you called my phone almost immediately after Rob had received that letter, it was immediately clear that you disagreed strongly with the spirit of that content (see attached first draft letter) and particularly because I had sought out counsel in order to make that response.  This was unexpected because the Restaurant 365 separation letter delivered two weeks earlier clearly suggests that I seek counsel before responding.  I was most alarmed, however, by your follow-on comment expressing your displeasure with my severance response in which you essentially said, as I recorded it immediately upon hanging-up from that call --- “I could sink your reputation in Southern California, making you un-hirable.  Is that what you want here?”  

Please know that I am only seeking some extra help from the firm to counterbalance what I believe to be valid reasons justifying this request and supplied in my previous letter.  I view this as a simple negotiation between us to see if we can reach some mutually agreeable conclusion so that I can sign your letter thereby releasing you from any potential future obligation to me.

Since your call, and upon further reflection, trying to understand why Restaurant 365 may have severed me from employment—especially considering the positive response by customers about my work (even you congratulated me on this) also my work ethic while employed at the firm--it concerns me that only three weeks before receiving this separation notice I had asked Rob Merbach head of HR about the possibility of taking a health-related leave of absence and also to _________, who works closely with ______ (founder) that I am challenged with a form of mental illness—my reason for contemplating this leave.  The timing of my separation is also concerning in light of the company’s planned realignment of its health care benefits and insurance coverage.  These points suggest the potential that my health status may have been factored into the decision to terminate my employment.

At this point, I have not notified the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) or the federal administrative agency--the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about the potential for discrimination toward me because of my health status to have occurred in this situation.  Rather, I am reaching out once more for help as I attempt to navigate to a new job.

Under normal circumstances, I would be happy to reassume my original job should it be re-offered, or to receive assistance from the company to find another position elsewhere.  But, considering your aggravation and even vindictive comment toward me during your phone call, especially considering my previous note that I suffer from an ailment that seriously challenges me—in this situation it feels unwise for me to appeal for either of these options.  Rather, the reasonable request seems to be some small increase of the severance accommodation afforded me to assist me in making this transition on my own.

In my draft letter to the company, I stated that I suffer from mental illness.  Despite this personal difficulty, which is now making it difficult for me to acquire new employment, while employed at Restaurant 365 I believe my performance was exemplary.  I never missed a day of work and routinely offered assistance well beyond my job’s remit.  In the time since separating from the company, I have rarely left my apartment.  Because I communicated my mental challenges to you in that first letter, it seems odd to me that a company that prides itself on helping employees seems disinclined to offer it now.  And thus my motivation forward write this additional letter.  

At this point, I hope to hear from your to see if we might amend the severance letter as suggested above.  


Regards,




Stewart

Rather than describe here my intent to file a claim with the DFEH and/or EEOC associated, failing your requested, which as I understand it, will be followed by discovery actions from both sides and overseen by the agency.  Under such discovery, direct questions to individuals in the company about the company’s intent and conversations regarding potential mention of my health and health insurance needs will be investigated, as will my own substantiation of mental illness status.






•	I have been informed that this discovery process under oath will allow me a significant ability to question individuals within the company concerning the thought process associated with my departure.  

•	You should know that another fact that appears to be associated with this situation is that the company is in the midst of changing its health care provision from one that is widely accommodating and thus potentially benefitual to me in that sense to one that might not be so accommodating and that my departure might have been associated with those converaat4ions as well.  Again, my preference is to have a honest and professional conversation with yuou, one in which you might ber willing to help me in my situation, rather than to have an antagonistic relationship in which we are only able to come to some sort of an agrememnet under the threat of future action on my part.


•	My point is that despite the challenges that I have, I was able to perform the work for your compay in a way that should have been satifiactory to you, with frequent efforts on my part to extend my services beyond that general scope of my job mandate.

•	And so considering these facts and the letter email that I sent to you upon your suggestion that you might be willing to help me find new employment – but without response from you, indicating what apperast to me to be little interest in helping me (perhaps because of potential concern that association with me might lead to borader action in connection with my declarion of mental illness and ultimate separation from the company.  

•	In all of this, I feel that the company has underserved me when in fact my whole interest and action was to provide service to the company for the betterment of those associated with it and particulary those whith equity ownership in the company.


•	On this last point, it would appear, especially considering your reaction to my draft (and in contrast inconsequential request) it may be you in particular and others in the company are so disinclined to associate with me that this might not be possible.  You should know, that I bear no such feelings toward the company and would happily rejoin as I had a great experience and association working there.





•	either find another good job and if not to increase the financial resources offered me in the form of a longer severance period to accommodate me as I attempt to make this transition.  And even more preferable to me than either of these two alternatives would be to continue to work for Restaurant 365.
